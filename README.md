The project is to give label to each tuple using both clustering and classification. Each step of the preprocessing has its own justification. 

1. The data consists of 20.000 rows and 26 attributes. However due to the file size, it can't be attached here. So I only uploaded the final dataset.
2. I did the research on two different techniques in preprocessing.
3. The result's summay can be seen at the .txt file attached.
